### Eminomicon:

I'm a Dofus player that started playing in 2005 on Rushu, (currently Tal Kasha, post merges). My primary team is currently Cra, Enutrof, Eniripsa, and Pandawa, and I've also done a significant chunk of content on a Rogue, Sadida, Feca, Panda team and assorted other level 200 characters.

I usually take pretty careful notes of mechanics and try to plan things out in advance a bit so I have some idea of what I'm doing in the moment. I've written a couple of guides, so rather than just posting to discord or reddit, I figured I'd put them here where I can start embedding screenshots, and control the formatting a little more easily, as well as making it more searchable.

I have a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/eminomicon) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQucN0JBzGiIcioV5CbOCg) channel that I sometimes stream or upload videos to, respectively. I also maintain a variety of high-level sets on [DofusLab](https://dofuslab.io/user/Saone/)

### Jake:

I'm Jake. I started playing Dofus in 2008. I really enjoy RPGs, my favorite video games (besides Dofus) are Chrono Trigger and Neverwinter Nights 2. 

My first team on dofus was Cra/Elio/Enu/Iop, I played this team through a lot of content, but eventually grew unsatisfied. I had a lot of fun playing a CC build in Temporis IV, so I decided to make a new team that would focus on CC: Eni/Hupper/Ougi/Panda. This team quickly became my "main" team and surpassed my first team in quests completed. I have also started a new team of Sram/Feca/Panda/Eca, but I have not done much content with them and I'm thinking about changing it up.
