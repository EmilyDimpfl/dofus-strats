This is a Dofus strat blog for various fights and quests.

I'm a Dofus player that started playing In 2003 on Rushu, (currently Echo) who is generally years behind current content. My primary team is currently Cra, Enutrof, Eniripsa, and Pandawa, and I'm gradually working my way through various questlines and dungeons.

I usually take pretty careful notes of mechanics and try to plan things out in advance a bit so I have some idea of what I'm doing in the moment. I've written a couple of them, so rather than just posting to reddit, I figured I'd put them here where I can start embedding screenshots, and control the formatting a little more easily.

I'm making my notes for these various fights and such available in the hopes that they're helpful for others!
