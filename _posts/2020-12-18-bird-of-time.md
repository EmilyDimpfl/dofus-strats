I just got Cloudy Dofus done with my team recently, and since information for `$current_patch$` can be scarce, I wanted to post what I did to get it down. This is partly the notes I made while figuring out my strategy, and some post-fight notes of stuff that happened in the actual fight.

I hope this is helpful!

## General notes:

My initiative order was Enutrof, Eniripsa, Pandawa, Cra, and from left to right spawns I had Enu, Eni, Cra, Panda

Because of how Bird of Time's glyph works, that meant the Cra had to cast her summon a turn earlier than the other characters to make sure she had the glyph to protect her from Bird of Time's -res% attack on turns 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Ultimately, she was fine with just using recall beacon because it has a short, 2 turn cooldown.

However, my Eni didn't have a spammable summon spell, and **Bird of Time seems to destroy Cawwots pretty aggressively now**, so I needed to use Enu's Living Spade to block Eni summons in for the second set of glyphs. I could alternate between Coney (which I killed later with my Cra and Eni), Arachnee, and Cawwot.

With this strat, each character only ever needed to move 1 tile, rather than moving multiple characters to melee to self heal or swap with Arachnees.

My party's maximum health was possibly a little low to deal with Erosion over the course of the fight, but everyone was able to survive the turn 15 attacks without dying. If I'd been more clever in the moment, I could have used [Bribery](https://dofuswiki.fandom.com/wiki/Bribery) to negate the turn 15 attacks entirely. The cooldown is pretty long, and I preferred to not move from starting positions, so if I was to do it again, I'd probably just use it on turn 14.

## Resistance gear and stats:

I used [Dreggon Helmet](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/8287-dreggon-helmet), [Aermyne's Rolling Pin](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/weapons/13649-aermyne-rolling-pin), and [Karmeleon](https://www.dofus-touch.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/pets/13182-karmeleon) on all characters for resistance.

All of my characters had all their characteristic points in vitality.

Dokoko on all characters helped a bit, although it heals less and less as the fight goes on due to erosion.

Watchers' Dofus on the left hand starting positions allows the two characters there to heal one another.

## Pandawa:

Panda spent the entire fight vibing in the corner self healing with Drunkenness and Cawwot, mitigating nukes with Fermentation and Boozer and was cool on her own without having to move to melee. I essentially just swapped her with her Drunkenness pot every turn, refreshing Cawwot when it was available, and Fermentation for nuke turns.

Notable equipment: [Dokoko](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/17078-dokoko)

## Enutrof:

Enu was fine healing with Pandora's Box, Watcher's Dofus (in line with the Eni), Dokoko, and 1x Regenerating Chest. She also summoned a Spade to go block in Eni summons, and another Regenerating Chest to go heal the Cra. Overall, she was putting in a lot of work to keep my other characters alive 

Enu can swap with her chest every turn thanks to her chest being manually positioned now if you use Summon Mastery. This made making sure she had a glyph trivial. I only used her Living Bag once early in the fight, which died and I replaced it with a second regenerating chest to help heal my other characters. If she'd had more summons (via better gear, or trophy, or whatever) it would have been slightly easier on her. She was still able to sleep her way through the fight pretty hard though - if anyone had needed more optimization for a numbers advantage, it was my Cra.

Notable equipment: [Dokoko](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/17078-dokoko), [Watcher's Dofus](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/16061-dofus-veilleurs), 3+ summons preferable

## Cra:

I thought I might need damage on Cra to self heal from Bird, but she had no problems topping herself up, and should have put on more vit trophies to be safer.

Notable equipment: [Dokoko](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/17078-dokoko)

## Eniripsa:

Eni took a lot of erosion over the course of the fight, and making sure Preventing Word is available for turn 15 (or turn 12 if Bribery is used on turn 15) might have prevented a wipe if her vit had been a little lower.

Notable equipment: [Dokoko](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/17078-dokoko), [Watcher's Dofus](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/equipment/16061-dofus-veilleurs)

## Post-fight notes:

It may be possible to block Bird of Time's attack by placing summons directly in LoS, buying extra time/saving health from being eroded. More testing is needed on this, however - Bird eventually killed every Cawwot I had down (even if it wasn't in the way of seeing my character), and randomly, an arachnee I summoned, which caused some resistance penalties on my cra on my first attempt. I'm still not sure why it targetted the arachnee, but I just used Recall after that and it was fine. In the old videos I watched, the Bird seemed to ignore Cawwots, but that seems to have changed.

All characters had around 4800 HP, but it got pretty spooky toward the end of the fight on my Cra and Eni, as they only had a few hundred HP after the turn 15 nuke.

Before the fight, I made sure everyone had Chaferfu, Arachnee, and Cawwot, but I primarily ended up just using Cawwot.

## Additional notes:

Here are a couple tables I made to help figure out when abilities would be off cooldown and such:

Survival cooldowns:

	cra:
		sentinel: 3
	enu:
		pandora's box: 3
		carnivore spade: 2
		miserliness: 4
	eni:
		preventing word: 4
		word of recovery: 6
	panda:
		fermentation: 2 (have to be drunk)

Summon cooldowns:

	everyone:
		arachnee: 5
		cawwot: 5
		chaferfu: 5
	cra:
		recall: 2
		tactical: 2
	enu:
		bag: 5
		living spade: 3
		regenerating chest: 4
	eni:
		friendship word: 3 (on death)
	panda:
		drunkenness: 5
		spirit bond: 6

I know I'm literally years behind on this, but I thought this information might help other people working on figuring out this fight with classes in 2.57. :)
