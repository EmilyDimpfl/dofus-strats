I just carried a friend through Giant Kralove for their Ochre Dofus quest, and while I didn't take much in the way of notes before starting (as to not keep them waiting), I wanted to write something down post-fight to help me next time I do this (hopefully for my own Ochre Dofus!) - in particular, I wanted to figure out which turns I wanted to use various spells on, in order to have damage buffs (and so on) ready to go when the Giant Kralove is vulnerable.

My team composition for this fight was Cra, Enutrof, Eniripsa, and Pandawa, and my friend played a Ecaflip, so this is from the perspective of a ranged team with those classes.

## General Notes:

Giant Kralove begins the fight alone on it's map, with the players starting nearly as far away as possible. It will attack enemies in line of sight for a few hundred damage each turn, so it's best to hide behind one another, or behind a summon to avoid taking damage.

When the Giant Kralove is hit with an elemental attack, it will summon a tentacle on it's next turn of the matching element:

* Water: causes players that it hits with it's AoE to skip a turn.
* Fire: deals large amounts of air damage according to the Wiki.
* Earth: applies a poison to targets.
* Air: melee attack instant-kills a target. It also casts Natural Motivation, which gives it AP.

The Fire and Earth tentacles didn't particularly seem to do anything threatening, but the Water and Air tentacles are the most dangerous.

It's worth noting that the Air tentacle can't attack on the first turn it spawns, as it won't have enough AP.

* * *
### ???
I wasn't able to find out why you have to do this, but the wiki says so, so that's what we did - apparently the tentacles must be summoned in a specific order:

**Water ‚û° Fire ‚û° Earth ‚û° Air**
* * *

It's also worth noting that the Kralove summons tentacles on the nearest visible target (as far as I could find) and not on the player that hit it, or something along those lines. Because Kralove is a no-redo kind of fight (since it takes 42 players to open it's lair), there wasn't a lot of room for experimenting, so I tried to build in safeguards to our strategy. 

Thus, for the first tentacle (water) we spawned, in order to make sure that we were able to get it out of the group, we put the Pandawa in the back of the group so we could be sure that her turn wouldn't be skipped, allowing her to pick up the tentacle and throw it to the side where we planned to group up the Water, Fire, and Earth tentacles.

The Enutrof used her Living Chest (the one with lock) to lock the tentacle in place - I wanted to save my Panda's movement speed skill for later in the fight when the Earth tentacle came out to make sure that I could throw that tentacle behind the panda's Pandawasta/Sprit Bond. 

Our initiative order was Cra, Pandawa, Ecaflip, Enutrof, Eniripsa. Each turn, the Cra would hit in the element that we were summoning, the Pandawa would pick up the newest tentacle and throw it to the Pandawasta, and the Eniripsa would make sure the Pandawasta was healed. The Enutrof was using Clumsiness (and not Shovel of Judgement) on the tentacles to remove their MP - they don't have much health, and we were also able to do the Blitzkrieg achievement this way.

We positioned the tentacles more than 4 tiles away from the group, so when the Kralove went into it's enrage/vulnerability state and the tentacles gained 2 MP, that's all most of them had, and they weren't able to reach us. 

## Mistakes:

We made a number of mistakes (or at least, things that could be improved upon) throughout the fight:

* we buffed too early
* we removed our own movement (apparently healing someone removes up to 6 of their MP?) 
* I didn't create enough of a summons buffer in front of our party to avoid one shots from the Kralove late in the fight.

### Buffing early:
Buffing too early wasn't particularly bad, because of the four surviving characters going into the Kralove's vulnerability turn, only two of them had to take their turn to kill the Kralove. Even fairly poorly geared level 200 players should have little trouble doing enough damage to kill the Kralove, but I suspect that you can also soft reset by killing the tentacles (assuming characters have lived through the vulnerability turn itself). Again, not a lot of chances to experiment on this fight.

### Removing movement:
We removed our own movement points by healing. This was simply a mechanic that we hadn't seen in guides and posts about the fight. Our positioning was fairly sloppy and the Kralove got some free damage on our characters as a result. This ended up not particularly mattering, as the Pandawa wasn't healed and could keep throwing tentacles, and the Cra was able to continue hitting Kralove to spawn more, but it's something to watch out for.

### Summon buffer/blocking Kralove's LoS:
Regarding creating a summons buffer in front of our characters, had I planned better, I could have simply put two cawwots in the line of sight between our line of characters and the boss, but I messed up positioning the last Air tentacle. Before the fight while linking spells to my friend, I accidentally switched to the Pandawa's alternate carrying spell (with lower range) so I wasn't able to position the air tentacle where I wanted it in the fight.

I ended up having that tentacle off to the side (partially blocked from the group by map geometry) and a single cawwot in front of the group. This resulted in the Kralove killing the cawwot, and the Pandawa, who'd taken the front position in line after we'd spawned the water tentacle.

In the future, I plan to throw the air tentacle in front of the Kralove to block it's LoS from hitting my team, or simply setting up two cawwots in front of the team.

## The Plan:

This is somewhat general, and team members with Turquoise Dofus should be using their excess AP on Leek Pie (or similar) on empty cells to stack up the Turquoise damage bonus starting on turn 4.


### Turn 1:
* Set up Eni in front, with Enu, Panda, and then Cra behind them.
* Cra hits Kralove with a water spell.
* Someone pre-emptively cawwots in front of the team

I'm not sure how to keep the water tentacle from hitting multiple people, but since it spawns next to the closest person, positioning away from the front person/cawwot SHOULD help avoid the water tentacle being able to reach more of the team.

### Turn 2:
* Eni (and possibly Enu) gets hit by water tentacle, skipping their turn.
* Panda throws water tentacle to the northeast, summons Pandawasta next to it.
* Enu summons lock chest, living bag, and uses summon mastery to run them to the tentacle.
* Cra hits Kralove with a fire spell.

### Turn 3:
* Panda throws fire tentacle next to the Pandawasta.
* Cra hits Kralove with an earth spell.

### Turn 4:
* Panda uses Pandiniuras, throws earth tentacle behind Pandawasta with Brandy.
* Eniripsa uses Preventing Word on Pandawasta.
* Cra hits Kralove with an air spell.
* Everyone: long lasting damage buffs, Galvanizing Word, Cra buffs, Fortune etc.

### Turn 5:
* Panda throws air tentacle in front of Kralove.
* Anyone: Put summon/cawwot next to Air tentacle (Enu?).
* Everyone: final damage buffs like Greed, Decadence, Self-Sacrificing Word.

### Turn 6:
* Kralove vulnerable, everyone hits.

Note that this ends on turn 6 - if the team wants to take advantage of the damage bonus from Cloudy Dofus, everything could be delayed by a single turn by simply not hitting Kralove on the first turn and starting The Plan on turn 2.

There's also room for more detail, like preparing Atonement Arrow on turn 1, but let's consider that an ‚ú®exercise for the reader‚ú®.

There's also details like "Enutrof uses Clumsiness on as many tentacles as they can see" that were covered earlier. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Good luck!
