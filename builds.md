# How to Build Equipment Sets in Dofus

Dofus' equipment system is extremely deep and has many potential options for prioritizing various stats that characters want to achieve various goals. Because of the many equipment slots which can have a huge variety of stats, it's tricky to find the strongest combinations of equipment - often within a budget. 

Because of this, there's a lot of factors to balance when gearing a character. So, some guidelines:

## Level 1-59:

In the first levels of the game, raw damage is extremely valuable, and additional characteristic points are nice, but spells (especially before you've gotten higher ranks) scale poorly. Prioritize raw damage if you can.

Set bonuses are a great way to get an extra AP and stats in this range, and there aren't many trophies or Dofus that you can wear to boost your stats. Some become available at level 50, however.

## Level 60-100:

At level 60, you can equip a mount. Mounts are really nice, because they run faster, they can carry stuff in their inventory for you, give you stats, and if you buy a Global Pre-Sentient potion to feed to them, you can have them automatically run you places (although there's a few spots where this doesn't work, like Cawwot Island, and navigation gets pretty wonky in Srambad).

At level 60(ish) amulets start getting +1 AP on them, boots start getting +1 MP on them, and there are a few items (like Caracap, Gelano, and so on) that give AP. Most classes benefit a great deal from having a bit more MP and AP, so its often very worthwhile getting those items, even if it means you have slightly lower characteristic points. 

Characters can have a maximum of 6 MP, and 12 AP, though 11 AP builds are much more common. In this level range, having 8 or 9 AP and 4 or 5 MP is pretty good, especially if you're leveling for the first time.

Set bonuses in this level range continue to be excellent, and a great way of getting an extra AP and stats. Keep in mind that at level 100, you'll probably want to switch to Shaker and Nomad, however.

## Level 100-150:

At level 100, you get +1 AP passively, which is a big help. Although level 100+ gear starts giving you the opportunity to get more than a single primary stat on your gear, the amount of stats that you can get (and the limitations of mounts and so on) make it hard to meaningfully put a second primary characteristic to good use outside of having an alternative when an enemy has high resists to your main stat.

This is especially true in lower level content, where holdovers from older game design means some enemies will have 100% resistance to a specific element.

Trophies (particularly Shaker and Nomad, which give AP and MP respectively) are really good if you can afford them in this level range - although you'll have to give up set bonuses

## Level 151-199

Around level 150, multi-element builds become more viable. You can equip the highest level trophies, and there are a number of really good Dofus you can equip if you've done the quests or managed to save up enough kamas to get them from other players.
