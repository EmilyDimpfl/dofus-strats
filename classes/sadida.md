# Leveling

### Strength

Strength Sadida is the most basically functional leveling spec that Sadida has for 1-200, and sports consistent, ranged damage. It is quite slow at spreading infection by itself, but playing alongside another Sadida, or playing str/agi late-game can help a strength Sadida offset that weakness.

### Intelligence

Intelligence has awkward AP costs for low level play, comparatively few spells, and slightly worse range than strength. I found intelligence awkward to play on it's own, but high level cha/int sets for spamming Bush Fire can be effective.

### Chance

Chance doesn't get it's signature spell, Bane, until level 160, but at that point it becomes a monster in CC setups, especially after using Inoculation to spread infection.

### Agility ðŸ¥°

Agility doesn't become *good* until level 195, when it gets Paralyzing Bramble, completing its role as a debuffer and controller capable of spreading the infection state quickly. As such, it can be very strong in higher level content, but isn't used much at lower level.

# Early Endgame

Agility is the most immediately useful group spec available to players entering endgame with a Sadida. It has all the usual tools of a Sadida:

* %hp based heals
* pushes and pulls using treants
* self heals through Vegetal Altruism
* indirect healing through Tree of Life
* the usual contingent of dolls

It also spreads infection quickly, particularly on enemies that are grouped up, and has powerful MP reduction available via:

* Soothing Bramble (-4 MP).
* Paralyzing Bramble (-3 MP).
* Each Ultra Powerful's [Cutting](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/spells/details?id=14387&level=1) (-4 MP). This also removes MP from all enemies adjacent to allied Leafy Trees.
* Vegetal Influence's Treant's [Sylvan Shackle](https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/spells/details?id=13590&level=1) (-3 MP).

This adds up in a hurry, but you do want to make sure you protect your Ultra Powerful dolls and manage cooldowns. You should also try to use Soothing Bramble before using other MP red abilities on a given turn, since it's effects last for several turns.

At 199, consider using a set like [this agility mp red set](https://dofuslab.io/view/26db083a-1841-4df8-9e47-dbcb36bdf856/), possibly switching in an Observer for more range. This can upgrade into a level 200 agility set (below) without replacing every piece.

As a fresh 200, I'd get an agility mp red set like [this agility mp red set](https://dofuslab.io/view/78b8a6cc-ffaf-4606-a53b-94613f3fcf54/). Additionally, agility sets are extremely useful for questing in general, and this set is very accessible and very strong.

# Mid Endgame

I'd also try to get a [chance set](https://dofuslab.io/view/f7816468-ac38-4fb5-83d5-d426168f94fe/) ([12 ap alternate cha/agi](https://dofuslab.io/view/92e8902f-9820-493d-8050-01ca46c3d17e/)) although probably much more budget initially, using trophies instead of dofuses, using AP/MP items in lieu of exos, working up to this to make quest fights that require CC easy. Incremental upgrades are the name of the game.

# Late Endgame

Much later, I'd get a [str/agi set](https://dofuslab.io/view/62687f50-545e-4352-a4f8-0b79548b5405/).

There are some other variants and such that can be useful, like trophies for survivability and damage, or a 12 AP Cha/Agi set for CC fights. The holy trinity of dokoko, emerald, and ivory is invaluable for getting through many quest fights.

# Situational Decisions

The agi mp red set has a little more range and better mp red than the str/agi set, as well as having better agility damage. I use that set when I really need to make sure enemies don't move, the enemy is weak against air, or I'm trying to out-range things.

Stacking up trees around a stationary enemy and using Shake for huge damage can also scale to even higher than Strength's Force of Nature allows.

Quest fights that rely on being good in CC will heavily favor . It also plays a bit slower than cha or agi sets because your damage is lower until you get enough trees for Force of Nature to become worth using.

Force of Nature hits really hard, so once it's set up it can be worth using it even if res isn't great. Agi plays much, much faster because so many agi spells spread infection and you can do a truly incredible amount of mp red while also pretty effortlessly keeping your infections rolling and doing good damage.

# Additional Notes

Omni crit is typically bad because critical effects don't work with infection. Flat damage from Crimson Dawn can work okay, and it's a very strong (and very expensive) set in general. You'll generally see less damage than a mono set tailored for what you're doing, and Crimson Dawn doesn't provide as much in the way of control or support for your team. Most of your healing is %hp based and won't be improved by int, you won't have much in the way of MP red to actually succeed at removing mp, and spamming Bane for drain tanking will be weaker than with a chance set.

Mid range damage from flat damage sets can be good, and there's nice synergy with using agi to spread infections, and then spamming Bush Fire. There are sets like [this Unspeakable/Putrid Eye/Bearbaric set](https://dofuslab.io/view/035f934a-e371-44b1-bd92-5b43465d2784/) that are typically used in PvP that way (using Voodoo Curse rather than Bush Fire), but I've found that the effectiveness is pretty lackluster compared to other sets. Trying to do "too much" is something to watch out for.

The sacrifices required to get to the levels of mp red to be effective in PvE will drop your damage significantly, and I've definitely found that the agi set synergizes best. It's actually kind of hilarious how much main stat agility sets can get while also having significant mp red.

There's certainly fights (especially solo fights) where you need to decide what balance you want to go for - wave fights in particular where you need to make sure you kill enemies quickly enough to avoid getting overwhelmed. I often switch to Stalak shield instead of Cubist to crank up my damage a bit more at the expense of a little mp red.
